# Miscellaneous

1. Orthogonal Vectors -> Perpendicular to each other (dot product is zero)
2. Orthogonal Set -> If every pair of vector is orthogonal
3. Orthonormal Set -> Orthoginal Set such that length of each vector is 1
4. Orthonormal Basis -> Maximal Orthonormal Set
5. For a coeffecient Matrix A, if det(A) not equal 0, it has a unique solution, else it either has no solution or infinitely many solution.
6. Projection of a Vector v to a Subspace W
   1. Find an orthonormal basis for W, let's say ($w_{1}, w_{2},..., w_{n}$)
   2. $proj_{w}(v)$ = $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \< v, w_{i} \> (w_{i})$
