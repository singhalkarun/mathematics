Matrix: Rectangular Array of Numbers

Assume A is a matrix with m rows and n columns

* Element: An individual value. $a_{mn}$ => value at $m_{th}$ row and $n_{th}$ column.
* Dimension: m by n
* Row Matrix: m = 1 (1 by n matrix)
* Column Matrix: n = 1 (m by 1 matrix)
* Square Matrix: m = n (n by n matrix)
* Diagonal Matrix: m = n and $a_{ij} = 0 \space\forall$ (i,j) where i != j (All elements except diagonal elements are 0)
* Scalar Matrix: Diagonal Matrix with equal diagonal elements
* Rank: No. of linearly independent rows/columns

Note:

Definitions are simplified in the context of study.
